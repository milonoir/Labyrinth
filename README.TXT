                               About the game
This is a very simple game, where you are in a maze. The size of the maze is
up to you, you can choose it. There are easy, medium and hard difficulties.
The easy is REALLY easy. In this case the program creates you a very small
labyrinth and it doesn't take too much time to get out of it. Size: 16X16
squares.
The medium level is a little bit more complicated. Size: 32X32 squares.
Hard usually means hard, but not impossible. You may use the map very often.
Size: 64X64 squares.
(These labyrinths are random-made, there's no two similar!!)
So, the program will drop you into the top-left corner of your maze. Your job
is to get out of the maze, which means get to the bottom-right corner.
Pretty simple, isn't it?
If you do well, your name will be in the TOP-10 leaderboard.

Controls:
  In the menus you can select an option with the ENTER key, and move in the
  menu with the UP and DOWN ARROW keys.

  In the game you can move using the ARROW keys and see the map with "?".

  When the hi-score board is on the screen, you can clear it by pressing
  DELETE button. To get back to the main menu press SPACE or ENTER.

CAUTION!
  Do NOT erase one of the dat files either from the Drivers directory!

                        About Cathedral Entertainment
This is the first time, when Cathedral Entertainment (CE) made a computer
game. CE has done some utility programs in Hungarian (e.g. Top Secret series,
Might and Magic: World of Xeen TRAINER (in English), and some cracks).
Now, CE will produce computer games mainly.

Dogtagman:
I am the owner of this "firm" - but I'm the only member as well.
Greetings to all my friends, and thanx to Microsoft (I used PaintBrush and
MS Photo Editor to create this game).
It took me two weeks (exactly 14 days) to write it. I hope everyone likes it.

                                  Changez
This is a repaired version of the game. There were some mistakes and bugz
which are fixed now:
 - you may abort the game by pressing ESC and select "Abort game" from the
   menu;
 - if it is difficult for somebody to find the "?" on the keyboard, he/she
   can use TAB for the "show-map" function (this will reduce your score as
   well);
 - cursor is fixed when you have to type your name;
 - Text "Loading..." is fixed where it wasn't visual.
I hope these changes will make the game to be more enjoyable. :-)
